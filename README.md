Apiary Tap
====================

Once you've [installed Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), add the tap with
the following command (this is a one-time operation):

```
brew tap bixu/apiary
```

Thereafter, you can stay up-to-date with the latest stable release by
running:

```
brew upgrade hab
```

If you no longer wish to use the Apiary tap, you can uninstall it:

```
brew untap bixu/apiary
```
